## This is a BIG task
The mentor warned "it could be a lot of work" - they were right!

## Options:
1. Do it all (will take 4-6 hours)
2. Start with just Go files first (2-3 hours)
3. Ask mentor if we should focus on specific directories

## Recommendation:
Start with Go files in the `functions/` directory (not archived), get that PR merged, then do the rest in follow-up PRs.
