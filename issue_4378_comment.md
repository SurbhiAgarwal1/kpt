Hi @liamfallon,

I'm interested in helping with this EPIC. I see it has 4 sub-issues related to porting improvements from Porch back to kpt.

Before starting, could you provide guidance on:

1. **Priority**: Which sub-issue should be tackled first?
2. **Design**: Are there design documents or architectural decisions already made?
3. **Dependencies**: Do these need to be done in a specific order?
4. **Scope**: For sub-issue #4382 (moving documents), you mentioned needing to elaborate more - is that still the case?

I'm happy to start with whichever task would be most helpful. Let me know how I can contribute!
