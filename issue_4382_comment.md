Hi @liamfallon! I'd like to work on this issue.

## Questions

1. **Which specific documents** should be moved from Porch to kpt? Can you point me to the Porch documentation directory or specific files?

2. **Where in kpt** should these documents go? Should they be in:
   - `documentation/content/en/` (Hugo docs)?
   - `docs/` directory?
   - Somewhere else?

3. **Link updates**: Should I also update any cross-references between Porch and kpt documentation?

4. **Porch cleanup**: After moving, should I submit a PR to Porch to remove the old docs, or will that be handled separately?

Let me know and I'll get started!
