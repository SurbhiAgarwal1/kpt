Thanks @liamfallon for the guidance!

I'll start with updating the `set-namespace` tests first since it's used in many test cases. I'll:
1. Update tests to use `:latest`
2. Identify and document any breaking changes
3. Submit a PR for review

I'll create separate PRs for each function to make reviews easier. Will start working on this now.
