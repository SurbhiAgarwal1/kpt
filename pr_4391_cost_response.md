@nagygergo Thanks for the feedback! I understand the security concern about CEL cost estimation.

I've researched the CEL cost estimation API, but I'm having difficulty finding the correct approach for the cel-go version we're using. The API seems to have changed between versions.

Could you point me to:
1. A specific example in Kubernetes or Porch that implements CEL cost checking?
2. The correct cel-go API method for cost estimation in our version?

I want to implement this properly rather than guess at the API. I've added a TODO comment in the code marking this as unresolved, and I'm ready to implement it once I understand the correct approach.

Alternatively, if you have time to show me the correct implementation, I can test it and ensure it works properly with our use case.
